# Synthetic_Data_Generation_DS

A Github Repository for members of Data Science Stream from Synthetic Data Team
to contribute on codes, data, weekly progress, etc.

## Folders Description

Codes in development/testing are stored here.

dr_detector.ipynb: contains synthetic data generator and testing

sd_compare.ipynb: compares the detected relationships between synthetic data generated with & without constraints

sd_generator.py: contains synthetic data generator class and all necessary code; ready for importing

dataset_generator.ipynb: generate sample datasets for model training

benchmark.ipynb: benchmark the runtime of constraints detection and model building when the size of dataset changes from 2500 to 50000

### /data

All needed data are stored here.
